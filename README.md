# Jabal

Write Python code. Get desktop, mobile, and web games from one code-base.

Jabal leverages Brython to embed itself and run inside a webpage, and wraps and exposes mature Javascript libraries for game development under Pythonic interfaces.  To create stand-alone desktop executables, Jabal wraps Brythonic code in a self-contained Javascript environment.
